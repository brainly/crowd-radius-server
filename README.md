# Crowd RADIUS Server

This is the implementation of a small radius server that authenticates against an Atlassian Crowd installation
using the Crowd REST API. 

Currently only PAP is supported.

This allows to use your SSO authentication to be used from many legacy devices, appliances and systems.

The RADIUS implementation is based on tinyradius, v0.9.1 which is distributed under the attached and packaged LGPL license.
The actual server implementation was originally created for the Coalevo Project.
